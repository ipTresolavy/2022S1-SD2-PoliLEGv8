### ALU:
    - Negative flag
    - Implement logical shifts and EOR instruction
    - Implement MOVK and MOVZ (shift unit will come before the Ainvert and Binvert; MOVZ is and add of the shifted signal with XZR)

### Datapath:
    - Implement flag register (controled by the UC)
    - Implement sign extension unit
